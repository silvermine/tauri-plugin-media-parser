## Crates

### media-parser

A Rust module with no dependencies on Tauri or its plugin architecture. It
provides an async API for parsing MP4 media files, extracting metadata, tracks,
subtitles, and frames from local files or HTTP streams. It's designed to be
published as a standalone crate in the future with minimal changes.

See [`crates/media-parser/README.md`](crates/media-parser/README.md)
for more details.

### Tauri Plugin

The main plugin provides a Tauri integration layer that exposes media parsing
functionality to Tauri applications. It uses the `media-parser` module internally.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install NPM dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the TypeScript bindings:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Build the Rust plugin:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

### Tests

Run Rust tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

The HTTP default helper tests cover composition and validation, including accumulated
and empty origins and invalid headers. Setup integration tests using
`tauri::test::mock_builder` execute `Builder::build()` and Tauri's plugin setup hook:
valid configuration makes the configured defaults available in `State<DefaultHeaders>`,
and an invalid default header rejects plugin initialization. Tauri's `test` feature
is enabled in dev-dependencies.

### Linting and standards checks

```bash
npm run standards
```

## Usage

### In a Tauri Application

Add the plugin to your Tauri application's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-media-parser = { path = "../path/to/tauri-plugin-media-parser" }
```

Add the plugin permission to your capabilities file
`src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "core:default",
    "media-parser:default"
  ]
}
```

Initialize the plugin in your Tauri app:

```rust
fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_media_parser::init())
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

To configure HTTP defaults on all platforms, use `Builder` instead of `init()`:

```rust
tauri::Builder::default().plugin(
    tauri_plugin_media_parser::Builder::new()
        .user_agent("my-app/1.0")
        .default_headers([("X-App-Version", "1.0")])
        .default_headers_origins(["https://api.example.com"])
        .build(),
);
```

Per-call headers override these defaults regardless of header name casing.
`user_agent` overrides `User-Agent` in `default_headers`. Invalid HTTP header
names or values fail plugin initialization. Local files ignore headers.

When configured defaults apply to the requested URL, a per-call `Host` header in any
casing causes an error, even if per-call headers override all defaults. This prevents
the frontend from substituting the HTTP authority alongside Rust-configured defaults.
`Host` configured in Rust defaults remains allowed. For HTTP(S) requests where no
defaults apply, per-call `Host` is preserved.

`default_headers_origins` restricts all defaults, including the user agent, by
scheme, host and port. Paths are ignored and default ports are normalized. Calls
accumulate origins; an explicitly empty list allows none. Outside the list, requests
still run with their per-call headers, but without defaults. Invalid origin URLs or
non-HTTP(S) schemes fail plugin initialization.

Without `default_headers_origins`, defaults are sent to any URL requested by the
frontend. Configure trusted HTTPS origins when defaults include credentials such as
`Authorization` or `X-Api-Key`; the credential can stay in Rust.

HTTP requests accept at most 64 headers after merging defaults and per-call headers.
Unless a restricted default was inserted, redirects follow reqwest's default
policy across origins, regardless of the configured header names or combinations.
In the locked versions (reqwest 0.13.4 and tower-http 0.6.11), reqwest removes
`Authorization`, `Cookie`, `cookie2`, `Proxy-Authorization` and `WWW-Authenticate`
only on the hop that changes origin. This protection does not persist across later
hops: tower-http restores the original headers for each hop, and reqwest compares
only consecutive origins. In A → B/1 → B/2, `Authorization` is removed for B/1 but
can reappear at B/2, exposing credentials, including Rust-configured global defaults.
Other headers, including `User-Agent` and `X-Api-Key`, can be forwarded on the first
cross-origin hop. Configure `default_headers_origins` to confine credential defaults
as described below. Direct users of `HttpStreamReader` can use
`with_headers_and_redirect_policy` with `force_same_origin = true`.

If a default subject to `default_headers_origins` was actually inserted during the
merge, redirects stay within the same origin regardless of the final header names,
including when the destination is another allowed origin or a CDN. A per-call
override does not count as inserting that default, even when its value is identical.

Same-origin redirects keep the headers. Both policies allow up to ten hops.
Blocked redirects return `cross-origin redirect blocked: same-origin policy
enforced` for both HEAD and GET requests.

### JavaScript/TypeScript API

Install the JavaScript package in your frontend:

```bash
npm install @silvermine/tauri-plugin-media-parser
```

Use the plugin from JavaScript/TypeScript:

```typescript
import {
   getMetadata,
   getTracks,
   getDurationInSeconds,
   getMetadataValue,
} from '@silvermine/tauri-plugin-media-parser';

// Extract metadata from a local file
const metadata = await getMetadata('/path/to/video.mp4');

// Or from a remote URL with optional headers
const remoteMetadata = await getMetadata('https://example.com/video.mp4', {
   headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer token123' },
});

// Get duration in seconds
const duration = getDurationInSeconds(metadata);
console.log(`Duration: ${duration}s`);

// Average FPS of the first video track, when available
console.log('Frame rate:', metadata.frameRate);

// Get specific metadata values
const title = getMetadataValue(metadata, 'Title');
const artist = getMetadataValue(metadata, 'Artist');
console.log(`Title: ${title}, Artist: ${artist}`);

// Extract track details
const tracks = await getTracks('/path/to/video.mp4');
for (const track of tracks) {
   console.log(`${track.kind} track ${track.id}: ${track.codec}`);

   if (track.kind === 'video') {
      console.log(`Resolution: ${track.width}x${track.height}`);
      // Average FPS as a reduced fraction, e.g. "30000/1001"
      console.log('Frame rate:', track.frameRate);
   }

   if (track.kind === 'audio') {
      console.log(`Audio: ${track.channels} channels at ${track.sampleRate}Hz`);
   }
}
```

`getTracks()` returns each video's average `frameRate` as a reduced fraction
string. `getMetadata()` returns the first video's average as a number. Both
omit the field when sample timing is unavailable; fragment-only timing is not read.

### Cover art

`getCover` extracts embedded cover artwork. Unlike thumbnails, it works for
MP3 as well as MP4/M4A/MOV, and it returns `null` when the file carries no
cover, so the result must be checked before use.

```typescript
import { getCover } from '@silvermine/tauri-plugin-media-parser';

const cover = await getCover('/path/to/song.mp3');

if (cover) {
   // `format` is 'jpeg' or 'png', whichever the file embeds.
   console.log(cover.format, cover.mimeType, cover.data.length);
} else {
   console.log('This file has no embedded cover art.');
}
```

The `data` field is a view into the binary IPC response rather than a
standalone copy. Copy it with `new Uint8Array(cover.data)` when it must
outlive the rest of the response.

### Video thumbnails

`getThumbnails` extracts JPEG previews from H.264/AVC video tracks in
MP4/M4V/MOV containers. Other video codecs and audio-only formats such as MP3
do not have a thumbnail path.

Decoding uses the operating system: MediaCodec on Android, Media Foundation on
Windows, and VideoToolbox on macOS/iOS. The plugin selects the backend automatically.
Linux and other targets keep metadata, tracks, covers, and subtitles, but
`getThumbnails` rejects with `thumbnail extraction is not supported on this platform`.
No software H.264 decoder is bundled. If the preferred Android decoder rejects
the configuration, the plugin retries the software codecs provided by Android.

```typescript
import { getThumbnails } from '@silvermine/tauri-plugin-media-parser';

const thumbnails = await getThumbnails('/path/to/video.mp4', {
   // Input timestamps are milliseconds.
   timestamps: [0, 5_000, 10_000],
   maxWidth: 640,
   maxHeight: 360,
   quality: 60,
});

for (const thumbnail of thumbnails) {
   // Output timestamps are the returned frames' presentation times in seconds.
   console.log(thumbnail.timestampSec, thumbnail.width, thumbnail.height);
}
```

Fast mode is the default (`accurate: false`). It returns the preceding
keyframe, so `timestampSec` can be earlier than the requested timestamp. Set
`accurate: true` to decode the exact requested frame. Timestamps must be
non-negative safe integers, and one request may contain at most 4,096 entries.
JPEGs preserve the source aspect ratio, never upscale, and fit within a 320×320
box by default. Set `maxWidth` and/or `maxHeight` to choose another bound; when
only one is supplied, the other dimension is unconstrained. Downscaling occurs
directly from decoded YUV, before allocating the RGB buffer used by the JPEG
encoder.

Thumbnail output is capped at 256 MiB in total, including the envelope header
and JPEG payloads. Identical requested timestamps are decoded once and share
one JPEG payload. Distinct timestamps count separately even when they resolve
to the same frame. Large dimensions can reach the cap well before the
4,096-entry limit, and exceeding it rejects the whole request at runtime.

All `data` fields returned by one call are subarray views into a shared binary
IPC buffer. Retaining one thumbnail retains the complete response. Copy a view
with `new Uint8Array(thumbnail.data)` when it must outlive the rest of the
batch.

The plugin caches up to eight parsed thumbnail sessions. Remote sessions expire
five minutes after they are built, and local sessions after one minute without
reuse; concurrent requests for the same cold source share one index build.
Up to two thumbnail extractions run at once across sessions. Additional requests
wait before reading video samples; this limit is independent of the index cache.

H.264 decoding and JPEG encoding are prohibitively slow when their dependencies
use Cargo's unoptimized development profile. Add this to the Tauri
application's `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` for usable development performance:

```toml
[profile.dev.package."*"]
opt-level = 2
```

### Subtitles

`getSubtitles` extracts `tx3g`, `wvtt`, `stpp`, and QuickTime `text` subtitle
tracks from MP4/M4V/MOV sources. It does not decode CEA-608/708 captions carried
inside video samples. This Tauri command is MP4-family-only; a non-MP4 source,
including MP3, returns a parsing error. The lower-level Rust `MediaParser`
registry instead returns an empty subtitle vector for MP3.

For `stpp`, `cue.text` contains the decoded TTML markup without XML
interpretation or separation of `<p>` elements. Each decoded sample that
remains non-empty after trimming whitespace and NUL characters produces one
cue with its original interval. Parsing and rendering that markup is the caller's
responsibility.

```typescript
import { getSubtitles } from '@silvermine/tauri-plugin-media-parser';

const tracks = await getSubtitles('/path/to/video.mp4', {
   language: 'ENG',
   // The range is half-open: cues overlap [5,000 ms, 15,000 ms).
   startMs: 5_000,
   endMs: 15_000,
});

for (const track of tracks) {
   for (const cue of track.cues) {
      // Times remain absolute to the source and are expressed in seconds.
      console.log(cue.cueId, cue.startSec, cue.endSec, cue.text);
   }
}
```

A cue is selected when it overlaps the requested half-open range; it is not
clipped or rebased. `cueId` is the stable, one-based MP4 sample index, so it
does not change between full and ranged requests. `SubtitleInfo.duration` is
the raw media duration in `timescale` ticks; `startSec` and `endSec` are seconds.

Only a single, non-empty, normal-rate MP4 edit-list segment is modeled as a
scalar presentation offset before selection. Empty, multi-segment, malformed,
or non-1× edit lists degrade to a zero offset.

Subtitle filters behave as follows:

   * With neither `trackId` nor `language`, every valid supported track is
     returned, but only when their combined work fits the aggregate request
     budgets.
   * Language matching is ASCII case-insensitive. An empty language is a valid
     filter and normally returns no matches. A `language` filter may still
     select a group of tracks with the same language.
   * When `trackId` is present, `language` is ignored. `trackId: 0` selects
     only the first valid supported track; a positive value selects that exact
     track and is the narrowest track selector.
   * A selector with no match returns an empty array.

Unfiltered and language-filtered requests skip recoverably malformed or
unsupported tracks. Selecting one of those tracks explicitly by a positive
`trackId` returns an error instead of a partial result.

`startMs` and `endMs` must either both be absent or both be non-negative safe
integers with `startMs < endMs`. Use them to narrow a track that is individually
too dense even after selecting it with `trackId`. Subtitle work is bounded per
request: at most 200,000 selected samples and cues, 1 MiB per sample, 64 MiB of
logical sample data, 96 MiB of physical reads, 32 MiB of decoded UTF-8 text, and
a 64 MiB binary response envelope. Reads are further capped at 16,384 coalesced
regions of at most 8 MiB each, with at most a 64 KiB gap joined into a region.
Container-wide, I/O, and aggregate-budget failures reject the complete request
explicitly: `getSubtitles` never returns a partial track prefix or silently
selects fewer tracks in those cases. `getTracks` can distinguish a media with no
subtitles from a track that `getSubtitles` omitted, as long as that track's
basic metadata remains readable; it does not diagnose every malformed-track
case.

The plugin caches at most eight source-wide subtitle sessions, and therefore at
most eight subtitle indices, separately from the thumbnail cache. Each index
accounts for at most 32 MiB of retained bytes, so up to 256 MiB of index data
may remain cached, in addition to readers, cache overhead, and references held
by in-progress requests. All filters and ranges for a source reuse the same
parsed index; concurrent cold requests share its construction. Local sessions
expire after one minute without reuse, and remote sessions five minutes after
they are built. The source bytes must remain unchanged while a session is
reused: a local session kept alive by repeated requests is never rebuilt on a
schedule. Local path keys include file size and modification time; remote
content served by the same URL and headers may remain cached until its TTL
expires.

Clients making repeated range requests should retain one core `SubtitleIndex`
across those requests. Its cues keep absolute source times, so callers remain
responsible for clamping and rebasing them to their output timeline.

## License

MIT

### Third-party notices

This plugin links code whose license requires notices beyond the usual MIT and
Apache-2.0 boilerplate: the JPEG encoder carries an Independent JPEG Group
obligation. [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) records it, with
the exact text the license asks for.

That obligation transfers. The license requires the notice to reach the user
with the distribution, so an application that ships a compiled binary
containing this plugin must carry it in its own documentation, licenses
screen, or bundled resources. This repository supplies the text; including it
is the application's step.
