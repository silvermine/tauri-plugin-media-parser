# media-parser

## Overview

The `media-parser` crate provides an API for getting metadata, tracks, subtitles
and frames from a local or remote MP4 media file.

`HttpStreamReader::with_headers` accepts at most 64 header entries and returns an
error above that limit. It uses reqwest's default redirect policy across origins,
regardless of the configured header names or combinations. In the locked versions
(reqwest 0.13.4 and tower-http 0.6.11), reqwest removes `Authorization`, `Cookie`,
`cookie2`, `Proxy-Authorization` and `WWW-Authenticate` only on the hop that changes
origin. This protection does not persist across later hops: tower-http restores
the original headers for each hop, and reqwest compares only consecutive origins.
In A → B/1 → B/2, `Authorization` is removed for B/1 but can reappear at B/2,
exposing credentials. Other headers, including `User-Agent` and `X-Api-Key`, can
be forwarded on the first cross-origin hop.

`HttpStreamReader::with_headers_and_redirect_policy` also accepts
`force_same_origin`: `true` restricts redirects to the same origin (scheme, host
and port); `false` uses reqwest's default policy, like `with_headers`. Use `true`
when configured headers must not accompany requests to another origin. Both
constructors reject invalid names or values and duplicate names ignoring case. Same-origin
redirects keep the headers. Both policies allow up to ten hops. Blocked redirects
return `MediaParserError::HttpRequest` with the reason `cross-origin redirect
blocked: same-origin policy enforced` for both HEAD and GET requests.

## Examples

### 1) Metadata

```rust
use media_parser::{MediaParser, FileStreamReader};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> media_parser::Result<()> {
    let reader = FileStreamReader::new("video.mp4");
    let parser = MediaParser::new(reader);

    let metadata = parser.metadata().await?;

    println!("Title: {:?}", metadata.get("title"));
    println!("Artist: {:?}", metadata.get("artist"));
    println!("Album: {:?}", metadata.get("album"));
    // Average FPS of the first video track, or None when timing is unavailable.
    println!("Frame rate: {:?}", metadata.frame_rate);
    // Duration is represented as raw ticks with a timescale.
    let seconds = metadata.duration as f64 / metadata.timescale as f64;
    println!("Duration: {:.3}s (timescale: {}, ticks: {})", seconds, metadata.timescale, metadata.duration);

    Ok(())
}
```

### 2) Tracks

`VideoTrackMeta.frame_rate` contains the average FPS as an optional reduced
`(numerator, denominator)` tuple, such as `(30000, 1001)`. The Tauri plugin
formats this as `"30000/1001"` for JavaScript. `Metadata.frame_rate` exposes the first
video's average as a number. Both use the same sample timing helpers and return
`None` when timing is unavailable; fragment-only timing is not read.

```rust
use media_parser::{MediaParser, FileStreamReader, TrackType};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> media_parser::Result<()> {
    let mut parser = MediaParser::new(FileStreamReader::new("video.mp4"));
    let tracks = parser.tracks().await?; // Vec<TrackType>
    for t in tracks {
        match t {
            TrackType::Video(v) => println!("Video #{} {}x{} ({})", v.base.id, v.width, v.height, v.base.codec),
            TrackType::Audio(a) => println!("Audio #{} {}ch @{}Hz ({})", a.base.id, a.channels, a.sample_rate, a.base.codec),
            TrackType::Subtitle(s) => println!("Subtitle #{} {:?}", s.base.id, s.base.language),
            TrackType::Unknown(u) => println!("Unknown #{} {}", u.base.id, u.base.codec),
        }
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

### 3) Subtitles

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use media_parser::{FileStreamReader, MediaParser, TrackFilter};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> media_parser::Result<()> {
   let parser = MediaParser::new(FileStreamReader::new("video.mp4")?);
   let tracks = parser
      .subtitles_in_range(
         Some(TrackFilter::Language("ENG".into())),
         (Duration::from_secs(5), Duration::from_secs(15)),
      )
      .await?;

   for track in tracks {
      for cue in track.cues {
         println!(
            "#{} [{:?} - {:?}] {}",
            cue.cue_id, cue.start_time, cue.end_time, cue.text,
         );
      }
   }
   Ok(())
}
```

`MediaParser::subtitles` returns all cues; `subtitles_in_range` returns cues
that overlap the half-open range `[start, end)`. Cue times remain absolute to
the source rather than being clipped or rebased, and each `cue_id` is the
stable, one-based MP4 sample index. `SubtitleTrack::base.duration` is the raw
media duration in `base.timescale` ticks; cue times are `Duration` values.

Only a single, non-empty, normal-rate MP4 edit-list segment is modeled as a
scalar presentation offset before range selection. Empty, multi-segment,
malformed, or non-1× edit lists degrade to a zero offset.

The MP4 implementation supports `tx3g`, `wvtt`, `stpp`, and QuickTime `text`
sample entries. It does not decode CEA-608/708 data embedded in video samples.
Formats without a subtitle implementation, including MP3, return an empty
vector.

For `stpp`, `cue.text` contains the decoded TTML markup without XML
interpretation or separation of `<p>` elements. Each decoded sample that
remains non-empty after trimming whitespace and NUL characters produces one
cue with its original interval. Parsing and rendering that markup is the caller's
responsibility.

With no `TrackFilter`, all valid supported tracks are returned only when their
combined work fits the aggregate request budgets. `TrackFilter::TrackId` is the
narrowest selector; `TrackFilter::Language` may select a group of tracks and
matches ASCII case-insensitively. Use `subtitles_in_range` or the range argument
to `SubtitleIndex::subtitles` when even one selected track is individually too
dense. A filter with no match returns an empty vector.

`TrackFilter::TrackId(0)` is a literal ID in the Rust API; only the
Tauri/TypeScript layer treats zero as "first valid supported track". An
explicitly selected recoverably malformed or unsupported track returns an
error, while unfiltered or language-filtered extraction skips it.
Container-wide, I/O, and aggregate-budget failures reject the complete request
explicitly: extraction never returns a partial track prefix or silently chooses
fewer tracks.

#### Reusing an MP4 subtitle index

Repeated range requests should build one `SubtitleIndex` and retain it:

```rust
use std::{sync::Arc, time::Duration};
use media_parser::{FileStreamReader, TrackFilter, format::mp4::SubtitleIndex};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> media_parser::Result<()> {
   let reader = FileStreamReader::new("video.mp4")?;
   let index = Arc::new(SubtitleIndex::read(&reader).await?);

   for start in [0, 30] {
      let tracks = Arc::clone(&index)
         .subtitles(
            &reader,
            Some(TrackFilter::Language("eng".into())),
            Some((
               Duration::from_secs(start),
               Duration::from_secs(start + 30),
            )),
         )
         .await?;
      println!("{} track(s) overlap this segment", tracks.len());
   }
   Ok(())
}
```

The index retains compact sample tables, not subtitle payloads or decoded text.
It may be reused with any reader over exactly the same immutable source bytes;
using it after the source changes is a caller error. The convenience functions
`format::mp4::read_subtitles` and `read_subtitles_in_range` build a temporary
index for each call.

Clients making repeated range requests should retain one `SubtitleIndex`
across those requests. Because returned cue times stay absolute to the media
source, callers must clamp and rebase them when their output uses a different
timeline.

Index construction scans at most 1,000 MP4 tracks, accounts at most 200,000
subtitle samples, and retains at most 32 MiB of index data. A request selects at
most 200,000 samples/cues, reads at most 1 MiB per sample, 64 MiB logically and
96 MiB physically, and decodes at most 32 MiB of text. Coalesced I/O is limited
to 16,384 regions of at most 8 MiB, with at most a 64 KiB gap joined into a
region. These aggregate limits are shared across every selected track and
overflow or allocation failures return errors instead of permitting unbounded
growth. A budget failure never returns the tracks that happened to finish before
the limit was reached.

### 4) JPEG thumbnails

Thumbnail extraction is opt-in for standalone Rust consumers. Enable `thumbnails`
and exactly one backend appropriate for the compilation target:

| Target | Backend feature | Decoder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Android | `android-mediacodec` | MediaCodec |
| Windows | `windows-media-foundation` | Media Foundation |
| macOS / iOS | `apple-videotoolbox` | VideoToolbox |

`macos-videotoolbox` remains an alias for macOS consumers. Features for a different
OS, or `thumbnails` without a usable backend, fail compilation. Do not use
`--all-features`: the backends are target-specific. Default features are empty;
metadata, covers, tracks, and subtitles remain available without a video decoder.
Linux has no thumbnail backend.

For example, a standalone Windows application can depend on:

```toml
media-parser = { path = "../media-parser", features = ["thumbnails", "windows-media-foundation"] }
```

The Tauri plugin selects these features automatically. Use `ThumbnailIndex` for
repeated requests over the same immutable file:

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use media_parser::{FileStreamReader, format::mp4::{ThumbnailIndex, ThumbnailOptions}};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> media_parser::Result<()> {
   let reader = FileStreamReader::new("video.mp4")?;
   let index = ThumbnailIndex::read(&reader, 0).await?;
   let frames = index.frames(
      &reader,
      &[Duration::ZERO, Duration::from_secs(5)],
      ThumbnailOptions::default(),
   ).await?;
   for frame in frames {
      println!("{}x{} JPEG at {:?}", frame.width, frame.height, frame.timestamp);
   }
   Ok(())
}
```

`frames` selects the requested presentation frame, while `keyframes` selects the
preceding sync frame. Outputs are JPEGs bounded to 320×320 by default, preserving
aspect ratio without upscaling. Compatible GOPs reuse a native decoder within the
request. Compressed samples retain shared, bounded read regions through decoding.
Index construction and decoding run on the blocking pool; thumbnail and subtitle
index construction share the concurrency limit.
Thumbnail extractions have a separate process-wide limit of two active requests,
covering sample reads, decoding and output assembly. Queued requests wait before
reading compressed samples. Cancelling a caller does not release its decoder's
slot until the blocking work finishes. Existing per-request byte limits still apply.
Apple validates coded SPS dimensions against the existing NV12 limits before
opening VideoToolbox; SPS geometry that cannot be parsed is rejected.

## Native backend validation

Run the native suite on its matching operating system:

```sh
cargo test -p media-parser --features thumbnails,windows-media-foundation
cargo test -p media-parser --features thumbnails,apple-videotoolbox
```

For Android, build with an NDK linker and run the produced test executables on a
compatible Android device. Copy `tests/fixtures` to the device and set
`MEDIA_PARSER_TEST_FIXTURES` to that directory when running the integration tests.
The native suites compare B-frames, color conversion, crop, scaling, and output
limits against checked-in fixtures. Compilation alone does not verify decoding.

## Development
